Flappy Bird Game Report
Introduction
Flappy Bird is a popular mobile game that gained immense popularity due to its addictive gameplay and simplicity. This project aims to recreate the classic Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library in Python. Pygame provides a framework for creating 2D games, making it an ideal choice for implementing games like Flappy Bird.

Project Overview
Title: Flappy Bird Game
Framework: Pygame
Programming Language: Python
GitHub Repository: Flappy Bird Pygame
Features
1. Bird Character
The game features a bird character that can be controlled by the player.
The bird can move upward when the player presses a specific key (usually spacebar).
Gravity affects the bird, causing it to fall downward if no action is taken.
2. Obstacles
The main obstacles in the game are pipes that appear at regular intervals.
Pipes move from right to left, creating gaps for the bird to pass through.
The player must navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes to avoid collisions.
3. Scoring System
The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of pipes successfully passed.
Each time the bird successfully passes a pair of pipes, the score increases by one.
4. Game Over Condition
The game ends if the bird collides with the pipes or the ground.
When the game is over, the player can restart the game to try again.
Implementation Details
Graphics: The game uses images for the bird, pipes, and background. These images are loaded onto the screen using Pygame.
Physics: Gravity is implemented to simulate the downward movement of the bird. When the player presses the jump button, the bird moves upward against gravity.
Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions between the bird and the pipes or ground to determine if the game is over.
Sound Effects: Sound effects are used for actions such as jumping
